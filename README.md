# E-commerce Sales and Inventory Dashboard

## Overview
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze e-commerce sales, inventory, and customer feedback for Blinkit (Indiaâ€™s Last Minute App). It provides insights into sales trends, top products, customer segments, and inventory performance, with a user-friendly interface designed in Figma.

## Features
- **Sales Analysis:** Tracks sales performance (YTD, last 6/9 months) with a growth rate of -2.79% in 2025 compared to 2024.
- **Inventory Management:** Monitors stock availability (81.14%) and damaged stock (16.66%).
- **Customer Insights:** Analyzes customer segments, top areas (e.g., Ghaziabad), and feedback ratings.
- **Data Visualizations:** Includes bar charts, line graphs, donut charts, and dynamic filters for interactive analysis.
- **SQL Data Integration:** Created a SQL View (`ecommerce_database`) to preprocess and integrate data from multiple tables.
- **UI/UX Design:** Designed the dashboard layout and navigation using Figma, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience.
- **DAX Calculations:** Utilizes DAX for creating measures and dynamic titles.

## SQL View
The following SQL View (`ecommerce_database`) was created to integrate data from multiple tables and calculate key metrics:

```sql
CREATE 
    ALGORITHM = UNDEFINED 
    DEFINER = `root`@`localhost` 
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
VIEW `ecommerce_database` AS
    SELECT 
        orders.order_id,
        customer.customer_id,
        orders.delivery_partner_id,
        order_item.product_id,
        customer_feedbacks.feedback_id,
        orders.order_date AS order_datetime,

        CASE 
            WHEN delivery.actual_time > delivery.promised_time THEN 'Delayed'
            ELSE 'On Time'
        END AS delivery_status,

            THEN (_Customer_Meaures.Period_Customer_CY - _Customer_Meaures.Period_Customer_PY) / _Customer_Meaures.Period_Customer_PY

                             AND customer_feedbacks.order_id = orders.order_id
    JOIN delivery ON delivery.delivery_partner_id = orders.delivery_partner_id 
                  AND delivery.order_id = orders.order_id
    JOIN rating ON customer_feedbacks.rating = rating.Rating
    JOIN category ON products.category = category.category
    JOIN _Customer_Meaures ON _Customer_Meaures.customer_id = customer.customer_id
